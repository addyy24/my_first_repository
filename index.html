            <h2>About Me: 
                My name is Adofuss, but I usually go by "Addy".
                I currently work in the Quality Assurance Department 
                for a Medical Company, but I do have some experience
                in the technical support roles as I have previoulsy worked
                in such a role. I am currently transitioning into a Web Developer,
                and I am doing this through the DTTP program that is being organized by
                SkillHat, and I can't wait to share my knowledge and the different projects
                I will be taking on with you.
